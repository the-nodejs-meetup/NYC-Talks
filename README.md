# The Node.js Meetup

## NYC-Talks!

This repository serves as a simple mechanism for allowing the NYC Node.js community to
submit talk proposals, request commentary on them, and help create a queue of great
future content.

### Proposing a talk

To propose a talk, simply make an issue and fill out the template!

### Contributing to proposals!

If you'd like to contribute by helping potential speakers hone their talks before they're given, star or watch this repo! You'll get email notifications when speakers create new issues and propose new talks!
